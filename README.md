Project Title:
NBA Memory Game

EXPLANATIONS OF THE TECHNOLOGIES USED:
index.html, script.js, style.css

I created a simple memory game with NBA players. It is a 2 player game, where each player takes one turn matching the NBA cards. Whichever player scores the most points he/she wins the game. Once a player wins the game, a sign comes out saying "Buckets! You win". If the score is tied, a sign comes that says "Buckets! Its a tie". Once the game is over, a restart button appears where any or each player can press it and the cards get shuffled and a new deck is served.

APPROACH TAKEN:
I had many differnet approaches to this game. I wanted my game to flip the cards over when clicking on them. I wanted my cards to have NBA logos on the back of them and NBA players on the front. I wanted the deck to shuffle after each game, casuing a ranoom order of cards to appear when trying to match. I wanted the colors to be bright and eye catching. I wanted an announcement declaring which player was the winner or if it was a tie. Most importantly, I wanted it to work successfully!

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
1. I created an array of all the NBA players names with their images on one side of the cards. 
2. Added event listeners for my click buttons so all my functions would work. 
3. Added timers so the next player to make a move had to wait 2 seconds before flipping cards over, so there wouldn't be any confusion.
4. Added a reset button, that only pops out when the game is over because I didn't want any player to accidentally press it and have the whole game restart.
5. Added points to calculate how many correct answers each player gets.
6. Manipulated the DOM a hundred times to edit my game. 
7. Created class names, event listeners, divs, buttons, click counters, box cars, box buttons, timers, memory, shuffle, elements by id.  

* I USED OF GOOGLE, 3D SCHOOLS, MOZILLA DEVELOPER, STACK OVERFLOW, CLASS NOTES, SLACK NOTES, AND HAD SOME HELP FROM MY BROTHER IN LAW. 

UNSOLVED PROBLEMS:
Wow so many unfortunately! 
1. When i started working of this projet originally, it seeme like I was able to handle the tak and my biggest issue was getting my images to show. However, when I started working on my css and added different tasks everything would go haywire. I couldn't get my text to line up on the left side of my screen. My intent on doing this was so you wouldn't need to move the page down when searching for the rest of the cards. All 20 cards would be seen instantly. 
2. My biggest upset is that I couldn't get my background image to show. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING WRONG!!! I tried everything and everytime it failed.
3. My colors and sizes are off as well. I tried so many differnt colors that after a while it seemed like everything including my text was breaking off. So I just decided to leave it as it is before the whole thing crashes and stops working.
4. Another big mistake is I was concentrtating so hard on making everything work perfectly as I had it planned in my head that I definitely did not use alot of commits.
